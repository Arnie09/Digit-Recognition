# Digit-Recognition
Android app to utilise a CNN trained on MNIST to identify handwritten digits using tflite.

A two convolution layered 1 Dense layered Convolutional Neural Net was trained on the MNIST dataset. The resulting model present [here](https://github.com/Arnie09/Digit-Recognition/tree/master/CNN-Model) was converted to a tflite model. The model was then used to classify images captured by a phone of handwritten digits. 

Following are the steps of pre processing used on the image captured by the mobile device.

* converting color image/frame to grayscale

* crop the center region of image/frame

* blur the frame (to remove noise)

* Apply Adapative thresolding (convering to binary image)

* Apply Image morphological operations (dilation and erosion)

* Down scale the cropped image to Model Input size

The results of the small experiment are as follows:
